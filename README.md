# DkCoder - Scripting at Scale

> A few clicks from your web browser and four (4) minutes
> later you and your Windows and macOS users can start
> scripting with **DkCoder**. And all users,
> including glibc-based Linux desktop users, can use their
> Unix shells or Windows PowerShell. Nothing needs to be
> pre-installed on Windows and macOS. Just copy and paste
> two lines (you'll see examples soon) and your script is
> running and your project is editable with an LSP-capable
> IDE like Visual Studio Code.

> Unlike most scripting frameworks, DkCoder solves the problem of scale: you start with small scripts that do immediately useful things for you and your team, and when inevitably you need to expand, distribute or embed those scripts to make full-featured applications, you don't need to throw out what you have already written. DkCoder is a re-imagining of the scripting experience that re-uses the best historical ideas:
>
> 1. You don't write build files. *If that sounds like Unix /bin/sh or the Windows Command Prompt, that is intentional.*
> 1. Most files you write can be immediately run. *If that sounds like how Python scripts are almost indistinguishable from Python modules, or like JavaScript modules, that is intentional.*
> 1. Most files you write can be referenced with a fully-qualified name. *If that sounds like Java packages and how that has been proven to scale to large code bases, that is intentional.*
> 1. Your scripts play well together and don't bit rot. *It is conventional to add static typing (Typescript, mypy) when scripting projects get large. DkCoder has type-safety from Day One that is safer and easier to use.*

## Quick Start

The recommended way to execute DkCoder scripts is with the help of the `./dk` tool.
The `./dk` tool runs the build script you specify, downloading support files beforehand if necessary.
As a result, you can get up and running quickly without having to follow manual installation steps.
*Gradle users: If that sounds like the easy-to-use Gradle Wrapper, that is intentional.*

The `./dk` tool is compatible with Windows PowerShell, macOS and glibc-based desktop Linux. It can also run on Windows Command Prompt if you invoke it with `.\dk` rather than `./dk`.

Example 1. The game of Snoke as a set of scripts:

```sh
git clone --branch V0_2 https://gitlab.com/diskuv/samples/dkcoder/SanetteBogue.git

./SanetteBogue/dk SanetteBogue_Snoke.Snoke
```

Example 2. The documentation site as a set of scripts (on Windows there is an alpha bug; rerun the `--serve` command if it fails the first time):

```sh
git clone --branch V0_3 https://gitlab.com/diskuv/samples/dkcoder/DkHelloScript.git

./DkHelloScript/dk DkHelloScript_Std.Y33Article --serve
```

Example 3. A production webhook microservice as a set of scripts:

```sh
git clone --branch V0_3 https://gitlab.com/diskuv/samples/devops/DkSubscribeWebhook.git

./DkSubscribeWebhook/dk DkSubscribeWebhook_Std.Subscriptions subscriptions-serve --help
```

## Installing

In Windows PowerShell, macOS and desktop Linux:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/diskuv/dkcoder.git
dkcoder/dk user.dkml.wrapper.upgrade HERE
./dk dkml.wrapper.upgrade DONE
```

In Windows Command Prompt:

```dosbatch
git clone https://github.com/diskuv/dkcoder.git
dkcoder\dk user.dkml.wrapper.upgrade HERE
.\dk dkml.wrapper.upgrade DONE
```

## Quiet Mode

Any command that ends in `Quiet`, like `./dk DkRun_Env.RunQuiet`, will not print messages while dk initializes itself.
However, if `sudo` is required for elevation, then commands will be echoed to the terminal.
