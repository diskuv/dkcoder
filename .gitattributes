# > Creating PowerShell scripts on a Unix-like platform or using a cross-platform editor on Windows, such as Visual Studio Code,
# >   results in a file encoded using UTF8NoBOM. These files work fine on PowerShell Core, but may break in Windows PowerShell if
# >   the file contains non-Ascii characters.
# > In general, Windows PowerShell uses the Unicode UTF-16LE encoding by default.
# > Using any Unicode encoding, except UTF7, always creates a BOM.
#
# Hint: If a file is causing you problems (ex. `fatal: BOM is required in ... if encoded as UTF-16`) use
#       "View > Change File Encoding > Save with Encoding > UTF-16LE" in Visual Studio Code to save the file correctly.
